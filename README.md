# Homework Project: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented using Python. It showcases various OOP principles, including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, through neatly organized modules and classes.

## How to Download the Project
To download this project, you can either clone the GitHub repository or download it as a ZIP file.

### Cloning the Repository
1. Ensure you have Git installed on your local machine.
2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal emulator).
3. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yamabiko101/homework_001_OOP.git
   ```
4. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd homework_001_OOP
   ```

### Downloading as a ZIP file
1. Visit the [repository](https://github.com/Yamabiko101/homework_001_OOP).
2. Click on the green "Code" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP".
4. Extract the ZIP file to your preferred directory.

## Project Features
This project includes the following classes and functionalities:

1. **ClassName1**: This module implements the first functionality of the project. It encapsulates all relevant methods and properties and demonstrates the use of constructors and destructors.
   - **MethodA**: Brief description of what MethodA does.
   - **MethodB**: Brief description of what MethodB does.

2. **ClassName2**: This class exemplifies inheritance by extending ClassName1. It introduces additional features and overrides certain methods to provide specialized functionality.

3. **Utility Module**: This contains helper functions that support the main classes in executing their tasks efficiently.

4. **Main Execution File**: This is the entry point of the application where the main logic resides. Execute this file to run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Best Practices
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the project (e.g., classes in CamelCase and methods in snake_case).
- **Documentation**: Each class and method should be well-documented. This includes a brief description, parameters, return types, and exceptions raised.
- **Version Control**: Regularly commit changes with meaningful commit messages to keep track of project evolution.
- **Testing**: Implement unit tests to verify functionality and ensure code integrity. This can be done using frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest`.
- **Code Review**: Engage in code reviews to improve code quality and share knowledge within the team.
- **Refactoring**: Regularly revisit and refactor your code to improve readability, decrease duplication, and enhance performance.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a practical guide to understanding and applying OOP principles. By following best practices outlined above, developers can maintain high-quality, scalable, and maintainable codebases.
